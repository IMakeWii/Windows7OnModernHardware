# Windows 7 On Modern Hardware
# Warning
Take everything with a grain of salt, I essentially don't know what the hell I'm doing. I tried following https://github.com/rileyclos/ModernOldWin/ on my PC, and it said the Microsoft Software License Terms were gone. This could avoid that error, but still.
# Where's The Guide?
Not here yet, don't wanna make a repo telling people how not to do this.

1. My Plan - My plan is to install it in a VM (in Oracle VirtualBox) with EFI patches, install the drivers for my PC, apply the disk image to my PC's SSD, and it should boot... right?
2. Getting Started - So, I'll install Ubuntu (Linux) onto my PC first, since I don't want stinkin' *Windows 11* to say hi and hog up my resources, making it so that my VM runs like a snail. This is also where I have my backup OS, the Ubuntu Installer ISO, which is on my USB stick. You can tell I have to live with 4 GB of RAM, with an Intel Core i3 11th Gen. ðŸ¥²
